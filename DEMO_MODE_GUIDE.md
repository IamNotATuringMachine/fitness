## Troubleshooting

### Demo Mode Not Working?

1. **Check Environment Variables:**

   # Verify .env file contains:
   REACT_APP_DISABLE_SUPABASE=true
   ```

2. **Restart the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   # Stop the server (Ctrl+C) and restart
   npm start
   ```

3. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   - Clear localStorage and sessionStorage
   - Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Can't See Demo Login Button?

- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure you're visiting `http://localhost:3000/fitness` (not just `/`)
- Verify the `.env` file is in the project root

### Data Not Persisting?

- Demo mode uses browser localStorage
- Data will persist until you clear browser data
- Private/incognito mode may not persist data

## Security Note

‚ö†Ô∏è **Demo mode is for development/testing only!**
- Do not use in production environments
- No real authentication is performed
- All data is stored locally and unencrypted

## Advanced Configuration

You can customize demo mode by modifying the `DEMO_USER` object in `src/context/AuthContext.js`:

```javascript
const DEMO_USER = {
  id: 'demo-user-12345',
  email: 'demo@fittrack.app',
  user_metadata: {
    name: 'Your Custom Demo User',
    avatar_url: null
  },
  // ... other properties
};
```

## Support
